How to use the application

### - General
All pages, except the log-in page have two buttons on the header of the page, the left button (inbox icon)
can be clicked to be brought to the notifications page. Next to the notifications button there is a button that 
can be used to log out of the logged-in account (arrow moving away from a door).

### - Log In page
Log in with one of the accounts noted in [all-accounts.json](src/main/resources/json/all-accounts.json) and 
click on the button to log in (arrow moving towards a door). \
For ease of use I have provided some account details below.
